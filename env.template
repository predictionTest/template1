# Sonic Network Configuration
# PredictionOracle contract address on Sonic Network
VITE_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x9492a0c32Fb22d1b8940e44C4D69f82B6C3cb298

MARKET_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x017277d36f80422a5d0aA5B8C93f5ae57BA2A317

# Unix timestamp when contract was deployed (optimization: no polls exist before this)
# VITE_DEPLOYMENT_TIMESTAMP=1730000000

# Cache version - increment after each deployment to auto-invalidate user caches
# Format: YYYY-MM-DD-N (date + deployment number)
# Example: 2024-11-06-1, 2024-11-06-2, etc.
# VITE_CACHE_VERSION=2024-11-18-1

# How many epochs forward to scan for polls (1 epoch = 5 minutes)
# 20000 epochs = 70 days
VITE_SCAN_FUTURE_EPOCHS=20000

# Epoch chunk size for scanning (to avoid gas limit)
VITE_CHUNK_SIZE=5000

# Cache chunk size: how many epochs to load at once when reading from cache
# Smaller = safer for gas limits, larger = faster loading
# Default: 20 (recommended for most cases)
# VITE_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE=20

# Minimum retry chunk size when request fails due to gas limits
# The system will retry with progressively smaller chunks down to this minimum
# Default: 10 (recommended for most cases)
# VITE_MIN_RETRY_CHUNK_SIZE=10

# Epoch length in seconds (matches contract EPOCH_LENGTH constant)
# Default: 300 seconds = 5 minutes
# VITE_EPOCH_LENGTH=300

# Cache expiry time in milliseconds
# Default: 2592000000 ms = 30 days
# Since we only cache epoch numbers (not poll data), we can use long expiry
# VITE_CACHE_EXPIRY_MS=2592000000
